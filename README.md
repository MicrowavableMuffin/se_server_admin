# Space Engineers Server Administration Tools
_Install, Update, manage your SE server_

1. [Download](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd.zip) SteamCMD  
2. Extract the zip and move steamcmd.exe to:  
  %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\   
4. Now that steamCMD is on your path you need not navigate to the steamcmd folder (if you even left that around)  
5. start powershell or cmd prompt as an administrator so that you can install the Space Engineers Server.  
6. `steamcmd +login anonymous +app_update 298740 +quit`  

_you can now use this same command (as an administrator) to update the server when necessary._
